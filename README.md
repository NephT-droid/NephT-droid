- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NephT-droid
- I am a technical recruiter for BlockHunters Group, a crypto-native recruiting firm. 
We hire for recently funded crypto protocols and companies, backed by some of the most notable VCs in the space. 
When it comes to hiring engineers, traditional recruiters are limited to platforms like LinkedIn and X to
search for good talent. It seems clear that much of the crypto-native talent does not live on LinkedIn but rather here, on GitHub. 

On GitHub I search mainly for MEV, Rust, and Solidity engineers. If you are interested in hearing about our openings,
or would like to refer someone, don't hesitate to reach out. I am happy to chat.  

Thanks! 
Henry
